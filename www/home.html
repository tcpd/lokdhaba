        <p> Welcome to Lok Dhaba!
            <p> Lok Dhaba is a repository of Indian election results - both Vidhan Sabha (state level) and Lok Sabha
                (national level) - beginning 1962.</p>
            <p> The data in Lok Dhaba comes originally from the <a
                    href="https://www.eci.gov.in/statistical-report/statistical-reports/">statistical reports</a>
                published by the Election Commission of India. We have cleaned and treated the data and organized it
                in a tabular format (which you can see under the “Browse Data” tab). In addition, we have integrated
                data from bypolls and assigned each contestant a person ID. The latter lets us track individuals'
                career trajectories over time and is the first of its kind in the context of Indian politics. Using
                this information, our data allows identification of turncoats and incumbents.</p>
            <p> The Lok Dhaba data is free and open for anyone to use. We encourage students, researchers, media
                persons, policy makers and others to engage with our data. Read <a
                    href="https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/press-articles/">what we have published</a> using this data
                and <a href="https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/data-quoted/">how its been used by others</a>. Should
                you have any query and/or notice an error, please send us a message or write us at <a
                    href="mailto:tcpd-contact@ashoka.edu.in">tcpd-contact@ashoka.edu.in</a>.</p>
            <p> We have recently updated Lok Dhaba with the results of the 2019 elections to the Lok Sabha
                and 4 Vidhan Sabhas. These results are provisional, and will be finalized once the Election
                Commission of India issues its final reports.</p>
            <p> For more information, please see the documentation tab, which includes a detailed
                codebook containing all the variables in Lok Dhaba. Should you use any information
                from Lok Dhaba, please be sure to cite the Trivedi Center for Political Data at
