            Lok Dhaba is a project of the <a href="tcpd.ashoka.edu.in">Trivedi Center for Political Data</a>, a research
            center led by faculty members in the Political Science and Computer Science Departments at <a
                href="ashoka.edu.in">Ashoka University</a>.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Lok Dhaba's interface has been developed with open source tools such as R, Shiny, Plotly, Leaflet, data
            tables and rgdal. Our maps are originally from <a href="http://datameet.org">DataMeet</a> and have been
            cleaned and treated in-house. The Lok Dhaba software itself is open source under a Apache 2.0 license and is
            available from <a href="https://github.com/tcpd/lokdhaba">our Github page</a>.</p>
